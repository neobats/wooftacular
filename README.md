# wooftacular
The first operational iteration of the Wooftacular contest scoring platform.
This project provides weighted scoring for a number of categories in a contest. Originally made for a ministry's dog show, the show
required a variable number of entrants and a weight based upon the number of entrants in each category, with respect to the whole.
Additionally, the categories all had their own weights that would adjust the scoring respectively.
